    title: "Stiffness Fine-tuning in MEMS Sensors"
    excerpt: "- Nanomechanical sensors, known for their exceptional sensitivity at the nanoscale, can detect surface stress changes, and their nonlinear behavior can be modeled using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in COMSOL.
    - Manipulating the stiffness of these sensors, especially through introducing prestress using a highly stressed thin film, can enhance their performance, allowing them to respond differently to surface stress-induced bending.
    - By understanding and modeling the nonlinearities and post-buckling behaviors, researchers can leverage these insights for improved sensor designs, especially in applications requiring high stress."
