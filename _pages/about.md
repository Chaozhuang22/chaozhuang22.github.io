<strong style="font-size: 1.15em;">Hi there!</strong>

I am a third-year Ph.D. student majoring in materials science and engineering at the University of Tsukuba. As a part of the program, I also work at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) as a full-time researcher, where I am affiliated with the [Olfactory Sensors Group](http://y-genki.net/).

My research revolved around a MEMS sensor called [Membrane-type surface stress sensor, MSS](https://mss-sensor.com/), which is primarily used as an olfactory sensor mimicking the sense of smell in animals to classify different odors. Specifically, I built topology optimization models to explore efficient sensor designs different various materials and application scenarios. Experimentally, I also developed a PVD thin film protocols to improve sensor performance utilizing principles from nonlinear mechanics.

I am a big fan of using the Zettelkasten method to manage my knowledge system. This site is used to publish notes about topics that I have learned and read, and it also serves as a personal portfolio showcasing projects that I have beening working on. If you are interested in knowing more, check out my [resume](/assets/pdfs/resume.pdf) and [CV](/assets/pdfs/CV.pdf). Please feel free to contact me using links below.

Have fun exploring!
