<strong style="font-size: 1.15em;">Hi there!</strong>

I am a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering graduated from the University of Tsukuba. As a part of the program, I also work at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) as a full-time researcher, where I am affiliated with the [Olfactory Sensors Group](http://y-genki.net/).

My research revolved around machine olfaction realized by a specialized MEMS sensor called [Membrane-type surface stress sensor, MSS](https://mss-sensor.com/), which typically forms a sensor array to mimick the multidimensional sensory pathways of olfaction, therefore being able to classify different odors. My work can be divided into two parts. Numerically, I built topology optimization models to explore efficient mechanical designs for better sensing performance. Experimentally, I developed a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process to modify sensor behaviors based on principles from nonlinear mechanics. An overview of these projects can be found [here](https://chaozhuang22.github.io/featured/).

I used the Zettelkasten method to manage my knowledge system. This site is used to publish notes about topics that I have learned and read, and it also serves as a personal portfolio showcasing projects that I have beening working on. If you are interested, check out my [resume](/assets/pdfs/Resume.pdf) and [CV](/assets/pdfs/CV.pdf). Please feel free to contact me using links below (way below in the footer).

Have fun exploring!
