<strong style="font-size: 1.15em;">Hi there!</strong>

I am a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering graduated from the University of Tsukuba. As a part of the program, I also work at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) as a full-time researcher, where I am affiliated with the [Olfactory Sensors Group](http://y-genki.net/).

My research revolved around machine olfaction achieved by a specialized MEMS sensor called [Membrane-type surface stress sensor, MSS](https://mss-sensor.com/). I developed Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process to enhance sensor performance based on nonlinear mechanics, and automatic design models for sensor design optimization. The related publications can be found [here](https://chaozhuang22.github.io/publications/).

After graduation, I have been working on data analysis projects for fun. An overview can be found in the [featured page](https://chaozhuang22.github.io/featured/). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out using links below (way below in the footer).

Have fun exploring!
