<strong style="font-size: 1.15em;">Hi there!</strong>

I am a third-year Ph.D. student majoring in materials science and engineering at the University of Tsukuba. As a part of the program, I also work at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) as a full-time researcher, where I am affiliated with the [Olfactory Sensors Group](http://y-genki.net/).

My research has been focused on the development and optimization of a MEMS sensor called [Membrane-type surface stress sensor, MSS](https://mss-sensor.com/). During the program, I developed topology optimization models to explore alternative sensor designs. Moreover, I also worked on the experimental side and developed a PVD thin film process to enhance sensor performance utilizing principles from nonlinear mechanics.

I am a big fan of using the Zettelkasten method to manage my knowledge system. This site is used to publish notes about topics that I have learned and read, and it also serves as a personal portfolio showcasing my project experiences. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me using links below.

Have fun exploring!
