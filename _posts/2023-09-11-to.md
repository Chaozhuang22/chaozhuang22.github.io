## Introduction
Designing sensors that can detect surface stress is a complex task. Traditionally, engineers have relied on a mix of educated guesses and trial-and-error to come up with designs. But what if there was a smarter way to tackle this challenge? Here it enters topology optimization—a generative design method that allows us to create more efficient and effective sensors.

### The Challenge
Creating an effective sensor is like solving a multi-variable optimization problem. We have to consider:

- What materials should we use?
- What should the sensor geometry be?
- How can we ensure manufacturability?
- How do we keep it cost-effective?

## Our Approach
The topology optimization is performed using the optimization module in COMSOL multiphysics 6.1. For those unfamiliar with the method, I have written an [introductroy blog post](https://chaozhuang22.github.io/fea/topology-optimization/).

### How Does the Sensor Work?
The sensor works like a "bimorph," a structure made of two different materials. Imagine a "functional layer" that expands when it encounters specific stimuli. This functional layer is typically gold or responsive polymer. Below this layer is a silicon layer that doesn't expand the same way. The difference in expanding behavior leads to a "strain mismatch" between the two layers.

To relieve this strain mismatch, the silicon layer bends, which leads to bending stress on a special component called a "piezoresistor." This stress changes the electrical resistance in the piezoresistor, creating a measurable signal that tells us the sensor is reacting to something.

The key to a highly sensitive sensor lies in maximizing the stress on the piezoresistor. This is where traditional sensor designs often miss the mark, and it's exactly what we aimed to improve with our optimized design.

### Smart Design with Topology Optimization
Analysing 3D designs can be complex and time-consuming. So, we focused on optimizing a 2D layout of our sensor. This is implemented similar to a method used in a [COMSOL tutorial](https://www.comsol.jp/model/optimization-of-an-extruded-mbb-beam-75211). If you're interested in the technical details, you can check out our [published article](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230811143Z/abstract) for more information.

### What Did We Find?
Our algorithm generated a design features with a double-cantilever, where the piezoresistor is at the intersection of two cantilever. This design diverges significantly from traditional designs where piezoresistor locates at the center of a single cantilever.

By examining the optimization history, we confirmed that our design has reached optimality.

This special design gains its high sensitivity from the piezoresistor (the small black frame) being located at the intersection of two deforming bodies with different bending amplitude.
The high sensitivity can be seen from the distribution of piezoresistive signal between the optimized design and a conventional one, revealing a highly concentrated signal profile.

You might wonder why we used a low-aspect-ratio cantilever as a benchmark. It turns out that this design has been proven more effective than those with larger aspect ratios (see [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424708003439)), and it is exactly what makes this design problem counter-intuitive and challenging to solve.

## Wrapping Up
Topology optimization offers a powerful tool for designing piezoresistive sensors, allowing for more efficient and effective designs compared to traditional methods. Not only does this approach save time, but it also opens the door to novel designs that could revolutionize the field of MEMS devices. As computational resources become more accessible, the potential for 3D optimization will further expand, offering even more possibilities for innovation.

This model is just the starting point for a series of studies I'm working on. The model can be extended to include more complex materials like anisotropy ([read more](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-959X/acef44)) or alternative boundary conditions, opening up new design possibilities.
