## Introduction
Designing sensors that can detect surface stress is a complex task. Traditionally, engineers have relied on a mix of educated guesses and trial-and-error to come up with designs. But what if there was a smarter way to tackle this challenge? Here it enters topology optimization—a generative design method that allows us to create more efficient and effective sensors.

### The Challenge
Creating an effective sensor is like solving a multi-variable optimization problem. We have to consider:

- What materials should we use?
- What should the sensor geometry be?
- How can we ensure manufacturability?
- How do we keep it cost-effective?

## Our Approach
The topology optimization is performed using the optimization module in COMSOL multiphysics 6.1. For those unfamiliar with the method, I have written an [introductroy blog post](https://chaozhuang22.github.io/fea/topology-optimization/).

### How Does the Sensor Work?
The sensor works like a "bimorph," a structure made of two different materials. Imagine a "functional layer" that expands when it encounters specific stimuli. This functional layer is typically gold or responsive polymer. Below this layer is a silicon layer that doesn't expand the same way. The difference in expanding behavior leads to a "strain mismatch" between the two layers.

To relieve this strain mismatch, the silicon layer bends, which leads to bending stress on a special component called a "piezoresistor." This stress changes the electrical resistance in the piezoresistor, creating a measurable signal that tells us the sensor is reacting to something.
